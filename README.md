Android Developer • 3rd‑year Undergraduate Student

A motivated and detail-oriented Android developer focused on building well‑architected, user‑centric mobile applications using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I emphasize clean code, scalable architecture (MVVM), and practical backend integration. Currently expanding my skills in Android app engineering and backend services.

## Selected Projects

### GroCart — Android Grocery App
A complete sample grocery shopping application implemented with Jetpack Compose and modern Android architecture demonstrating an end‑to‑end consumer flow.

Highlights:
- Firebase phone OTP authentication + guest access
- Bottom navigation (Home, Orders, Cart), search and category browsing
- Responsive two‑column product grid, discount badges, pricing display
- Cart management with quantity updates, bill breakdown, and simulated checkout
- Architecture: MVVM + ViewModel + StateFlow, Kotlin Coroutines, Coil for image loading
- Theming with light/dark support and clean separation of UI/business logic

Why it matters: showcases real‑world mobile patterns — authentication, product listing, cart/checkout flows, and maintainable architecture.
